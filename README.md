# modifiedbowlingscores

This program will read input from a file, specified as a global constant, and assign that data to arrays.
It includes one array for the bowler names, a two dimensional array to hold bowler scores and another array
to hold the average scores for that bowler.

The function PrettyPrintResults is used to show output to user.

***BowlingScores.txt has been modified to accomodate for 5 games instead of 4.
